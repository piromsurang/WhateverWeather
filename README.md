# WhateverWeather
  WhateverWeather is an application showing the current weather of cities in Thailand.
  The application calls current weather data of one location from the openweathermap api by
  sending geographic coordinates. The geographic coordinates of each city is from file csv
  that I obtain from simplemaps(Geographic Data Products).
